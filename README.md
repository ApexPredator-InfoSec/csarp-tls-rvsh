# csarp-tls-rvsh
A simple reverse shell wrapped in TLS encyption written in C#

This reverse shell was based off of the one found here: https://bank-security.medium.com/undetectable-c-c-reverse-shells-fab4c0ec4f15 https://gist.github.com/BankSecurity/426d37639f571a0bd33c4d884423029f

It was modifed to use SslStream instead of Stream to encrypt the traffic with TLS. Currently works with TLS 1.2.
